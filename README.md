# Alurapic

This project was developed in the [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) Angular course.

However, I made several modifications (organization, structure, naming, modules, etc) in order to try out some ideas and concepts to verify the feasibility within an Angular project.

In this way, **this project does NOT follow the Angular Style Guide in its entirety.** *In many ways I followed another approach, because as already mentioned, the idea was to try out some different ideas.*

## Angular CLI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
